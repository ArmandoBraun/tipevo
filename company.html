<section class="company-intro">
	<p>Back in 2016, at a pizza shop in West Hartford, CT, a group technologists, program administrators, parents, coaches and athletes set out on a mission — to help simplify, understand, and navigate the youth sports ecosystem across America.</p>
	<p>Achieving this mission requires a sophisticated combination of innovative technology, communication solutions, and, most importantly, thinking about youth sports in a different way. It’s no doubt a tall order. But the good news is that much of the complexity which has transformed youth sports can be addressed and revolutionized by our company.</p>
	<p>TiPEVO was established to streamline the ability to search, connect, and play, creating the first solution of its kind. It is one that has all the foundational aspects to establish a universal market standard and foster a new youth sports landscape that prioritizes transparency, collaboration, and communication.</p>
