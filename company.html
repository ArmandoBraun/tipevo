<section class="company-intro">
	<p>The idea for Tipevo began with a thought. When did youth sports become so complicated, expensive, time consuming, and stressful?</p>
	<p>Over the last 20 years, America’s youth sports landscape has witnessed a profound shift away from the recreational, word of mouth model. Where youth sports used to be about accessiblility, affordability, simplicity, and enjoyment, over time it has become a high stakes, high performance model that is elite, expensive, complicated, and time consuming.</p>
	<p>This new ecosystem presents an overwhelming number of choices and challenges for families to navigate. In terms of sheer numbers, 45 million kids participate in youth sports annually with 2.4 million programs serving youth athletes and parents across every sport imaginable. As for the expense, $22.5 billion is spent on participation in youth sports annually, with families each spending an average of $2,300 annually.</p>
	<p>In a word, youth sports is huge.</p>
	<p>With all this complexity, youth sports no longer serves the people who inhabit the ecosystem, whether parents, program managers, coaches, or (most of all) kids. In fact, 38% of young athletes quit because they aren’t able to find the right fit. In the age of interconnected digital platforms from Facebook to Zillow to Yelp, how is is that there is no single solution to help families and programs connect with, navigate, define, and own the youth sports experience in a way that serves everyone?</p>
	<p>Tipevo is changing the structure of youth sports with a full-featured directory of centralized information that elevates the youth sports experience. Based on the principles of trust, intelligence, passion and evolution, Tipevo is committed to serving its parents, players, progams, and coaches to develop young athletes and great athletic programs by focusing on what really matters—the game.</p>
